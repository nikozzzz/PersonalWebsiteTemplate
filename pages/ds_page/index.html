                        Extracted frame semantic structures from Chinese text, addressing three tasks: identifying frame information, argument spans, and argument roles. Used pre-trained large models to generate word embedding vectors, coupled with innovative position encoding. Trained a transformer-based model to deeply understand events or situations in sentences, achieving a weighted score of 71.41 across the three tasks.
